# random unnamed chess game

This game doesn't have a name yet :skull:

This is a chess game made in rust so I have something to waste my time on.

Currently it's just chess but I plan to add more unique features later.

Btw castling is done by moving the king 2 spaces towards the rook you want to castle with.

The game has a server and client, you can run the server only using --server or -s in the command line and you can specify port using --port or -p.

It should be easy to host a server, although you will need to enable port forwarding which is easier said then done.

Maybe I can host 'official' servers but that would be after the game is closer to finished.

The game doesn't include a font so you got to download one yourself (more info in assets/fonts/note.txt).

Inspired by Chess Battle Advanced (yes I know that's not a real game) and [Icely Puzzles](https://www.youtube.com/@IcelyPuzzles).

## known bugs

None at the moment.

Starting a game after already having played one is buggy.

Some missing features.

All visuals are bad.

If you want to contribute (for whatever reason) just make a PR that follows clippy lints and cargo fmt (or not, I guess I can fix them on my own).
