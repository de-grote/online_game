# random unnamed chess game

This game doesn't have a name yet :skull:

This is a chess game made in rust so I have something to waste my time on (and )

Currently it's just chess but i plan to add more unique features later.

The game has a server and client, currently it can only connect to localhost but that is because the title screen isn't made yet...

I am planning to make it easy to host a server, although you will need to enable port forwarding which is easier said then done.

Maybe I can host 'official' servers but that would be after the game is closer to finished.

The game doesn't include a font so you got to download one yourself (more info in assets/fonts/note.txt)

Inspired by Chess Battle Advanced (yes I know that's not a real game) and [Icely Puzzles](https://www.youtube.com/@IcelyPuzzles).

## known bugs
There is no win or draw detection (the game doesn't end ever basically)

You can take a king

You can move your king into check

Castling is just build different atm (easy fix just lazy)

All visuals are bad

If you want to contribute (for whatever reason) just make a PR that follows clippy lints and cargo fmt (or not, I guess I can fix them on my own)
